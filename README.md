## **About The Project**

Welcome to AI Arcade Classics, a collection of retro arcade games reimagined for the modern web. This project explores the capabilities of AI in software development by recreating the look, feel, and fun of timeless arcade classics.

Each game was developed as a creative collaboration with Gemini, a large language model from Google, resulting in modern, single-file web applications.

## **Games Included**

This collection features the following classic games:

* Retrovaders (Space Invaders)
* Retroids (Asteroids)  
* Retroman (Pac Man)  
* Retrofrog (Frogger)  
* Retrobubble (Bubble Bobble)  
* Retris (Tetris)

## **Tech Stack**

This project was developed using fundamental web technologies:

* **HTML5:** For the structure and content of the web pages.  
* **CSS3:** For styling, layout, and creating the retro, CRT-monitor aesthetic.  
* **JavaScript (with Canvas 2D):** For game logic, rendering graphics, and handling user input within each game.
